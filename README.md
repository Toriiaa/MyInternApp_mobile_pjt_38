# MyInternApp-mobile-pjt-38
MyIntern app is a job web app and mobile app targeted at students at the tertiary level of education. This app will help students who are looking for temporary jobs they can take up during their school breaks, or part-time jobs they can do while in school. This will give them an opportunity to gain experience and also earn money. Employers who need interns for a short period (2weeks - 3 months) will register their needs on the Intern app with the full details of the job description and employment terms. The app verifies the employer and ensures that they are a legitimate business or company. Students can register on the app, upload their CV and other works, and apply for available job positions depending on the location, job duration, job category.

### Benefits
- Students get to work on real-life projects.
- Students get to learn about the work environment cultures even before they leave school.
